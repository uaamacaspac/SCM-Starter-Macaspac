# Module 2 Project

This project utilizes a blockchain development setup with Hardhat and Metamask, focusing on Ethereum transactions within a localhost network.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Starter Template**:
   - Begin by cloning the starter template from Chris's repository.

2. **Modify Assessment Contract**:
   - Modified the assessment contract to enhance functionalities and change the theme:
     - Added custom time increase
     - Added custom time reduction
     - Added time transfer to other person(address)

3. **Edit `index.js`**:
   - Updated `index.js` to accommodate expanded functionalities:
     - Modified the code for increasing and reducing time.
     - Added inputs and button to add time transfer functionality in frontend.

4. **Run Codes and Contract**:
   - Start the Hardhat node for the localhost network:

     ```
     npx hardhat node
     ```

   - Deploy the contracts:

     ```
     npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
     ```

   - Launch the frontend:

     ```
     npm run dev
     ```

5. **Metamask Setup**:
   - Configure Metamask for the localhost network.
   - Import accounts generated by `npx hardhat node`.

## Usage

- Access the application via `npm run dev`.
- Utilize Metamask to interact with modified contract functionalities.

## Notes

- Ensure Metamask reflects the correct localhost network settings.
