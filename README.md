# Project README

This project utilizes a blockchain development setup with Hardhat and Metamask, focusing on Ethereum transactions within a localhost network.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Starter Template**:
   - Begin by cloning the starter template from Chris's repository.

     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     ```

2. **Modify Assessment Contract**:
   - Edited the assessment contract to enhance functionalities:
     - Enabled deposit and withdrawal of any value.
     - Added a transfer function from the ATM to specified addresses (not functional on localhost due to network constraints).

3. **Edit `index.js`**:
   - Updated `index.js` to accommodate expanded functionalities:
     - Added inputs for deposit and withdrawal amounts.
     - Integrated inputs for ETH transfer amount and target address.

4. **Run Codes and Contract**:
   - Start the Hardhat node for the localhost network:

     ```
     npx hardhat node
     ```

   - Deploy the contracts:

     ```
     npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
     ```

   - Launch the frontend:

     ```
     npm run dev
     ```

5. **Metamask Setup**:
   - Configure Metamask for the localhost network.
   - Import accounts generated by `npx hardhat node`.

## Usage

- Access the application via `npm run dev`.
- Utilize Metamask to interact with modified contract functionalities.

## Notes

- Ensure Metamask reflects the correct localhost network settings.
- The transfer feature is inactive during development due to limitations with localhost and dummy addresses.
